#+title: Using Docker Desktop to Create a Development Web Server
#+description: 
#+slug: docker-local-web-server

When developing websites locally, I often use a simple Python web server to
observe the changes.

#+begin_src sh
python3 -m http.server
#+end_src

However, this approach has its limitations. For example, this approach does not
enable logging or access controls. You also need to customize =SimpleHTTPServer=
if you have advanced needs from your web server.

So, I went to find an alternative that is almost as easy and far more extensible
and found Docker Desktop to be a suitable replacement.

* Docker Desktop

** Installation

[[https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/][Docker Desktop]] is a desktop GUI for the phenomenal Docker container software.
This allows you to manage containers, images, volumes, environments, and
extensions via an easy-to-use GUI.

To install, open the link above and click the =Download= button for your
platform. I'm going through this process on an M2 Macbook, so I downloaded the
Mac - Apple Chip version.

Open the installer and follow the installation process until the application
finishes the installation process.

** Creating an Nginx Container

I prefer to use the command line to create containers, so the following commands
will be input via the terminal.

The following command will create a container, using the =nginx= image:

1. =-d=: Run this container as a daemon (detach)
2. =-p=: Allocate a port in the format =<external>:<internal>=
3. =-i=: Keep STDIN open even if not attached
4. =-t=: Allocate a pseudo-TTY
5. =-p=: Allocate a port in the format =<external>:<internal>=
6. =--rm=: Remove the container once it's done running

#+begin_src sh
docker run -it --rm -d -p 8000:80 --name web nginx
#+end_src

You can navigate to [[http://localhost:8000]] to see the resulting page.

** Customizing the Nginx Container

Now that I have a container running the Nginx web server, I need to link some
volumes so that I can modify the site configuration and provide the web files to
serve.

Let's start with the new command, which adds two volumes:

1. =<your_content>:/usr/share/nginx/html=: This is the directory where you will
   provide the web pages for the server to serve.
2. =<your_config>:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf=: This is the Nginx
   configuration file for your site.

To see the updates, you can delete the previous container in the GUI or run
=docker stop web= to stop the container. Once stopped, you can run the new
=docker run= command below.

#+begin_src sh
docker run -it -d -p 8000:80 --name web -v ~/Source/cleberg.net/.build:/usr/share/nginx/html -v ~/Source/cleberg.net/nginx-config.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf nginx
#+end_src

Here's an example of my development configuration file.

#+begin_src conf
# nginx-config.conf
server {
       server_name cleberg.net www.cleberg.net;

       root /usr/share/nginx/html;
       index index.html;
       autoindex on;

       access_log  /var/log/nginx/cleberg.net.access.log;
       error_log  /var/log/nginx/cleberg.net.error.log;

       location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
       }

       listen [::]:80;
       listen 80;
}
#+end_src

* Customizing Deployment Actions

I am currently blogging with [[https://emacs.love/weblorg/][weblorg]], which uses a custom =publish.el= file to
build the static site. Within this file, I have configured my deployment process
to check for the =ENV= variable in thesh and if it's set to =prod=, the script
will set the base URLs to =https://cleberg.net=. If not, it sets the base URLs
to =localhost:8000= (which matches the port used in the container above).

Therefore, I have modified my =build.sh= script to build with =localhost= URLs
if =ENV= is not set to =prod=. It also prevents the build process from sending
the built files to the production web server.

#+begin_src sh
#!/bin/bash

if [ "$ENV" == "prod" ]; then
    echo "Environment = Production"              && \
    rm -rf .build/*                              && \
    emacs --script publish.el                    && \
    scp -r .build/* ubuntu:/var/www/cleberg.net/
else
    echo "Environment = Development"             && \
    rm -rf .build/*                              && \
    emacs --script publish.el
fi
#+end_src

You can modify the container in numerous ways and this approach allows you to
create complex scenarios for your web development purposes. I highly recommend
switching over to a container-based approach for simple, local web development.
