#+title: Self-Hosting Tandoor Recipe Manager
#+description: Learn how to self-host Tandoor, the smart recipe management web app.
#+filetags: :self-hosting:
#+slug: self-hosting-tandoor

* Overview

[[https://tandoor.dev/][Tandoor]] is a smart recipe manager web application that allows you to:
- Store your recipes
- Search for recipes and ingredients
- Share recipes with a link and permission system
- Put recipes and ingredients into a shopping list
- Plan your meals with a built-in calendar
- Calculate nutritional values
- Import recipes from websites and apps
- Load existing recipes

* Installation

[[https://docs.tandoor.dev/][The Tandoor docs]] contain all of the relevant information needed to get start
with the self-hosting process.

This tutorial will use Docker Compose and Nginx on Ubuntu 24.04.1.

** Docker Compose

On your machine, create a directory for Tandoor and copy down the =.env= and
=docker-compose.yml= templates:

#+begin_src shell
mkdir ~/tandoor cd ~/tandoor wget
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vabene1111/recipes/develop/.env.template -O .env wget
# Plain version of docker-compose.yml
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vabene1111/recipes/develop/docs/install/docker/plain/docker-compose.yml
#+end_src

Within these files, customize as needed.
- =.env=
  - Add a =SECRET_KEY=
  - Define the =ALLOWED_HOSTS=
  - Set the =POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
- =docker-compose.yml=
  - Update the =ports= since Nginx on my host is already using port 80 (e.g.
    =8087:80=)

Once you've updated and saved the files, you can launch the container.

#+begin_src shell
sudo docker compose up -d
#+end_src

The application is now available at =localhost:8087= or =ip_address:8087= if
accessing via a different machine. If accessing via a different machine,
remember to allow port =8087= through any existing firewalls.

** Nginx Reverse Proxy

Now that Tandoor is available locally, let's connect it to the Nginx web server
running on the host machine.

#+begin_quote
Note: I use Nginx configuration files within the =conf.d= directory, but you may
need to use the =sites-available= directory, depending on your installation of
Nginx.
#+end_quote

#+begin_src shell
cd /etc/nginx/conf.d/
sudo nano recipes.conf
#+end_src

Within this file, define your website configuration. The example below is my
default configuration and utilizes a wildcard certificate for =*.example.com=
that covers all of my subdomains. If you don't have a wildcard certificate, you
will need to generate an SSL certificate for your domain.

#+begin_src config
server {
        listen                  443 ssl;
        listen                  [::]:443 ssl;
        http2                   on;
        server_name             recipes.example.com;

        # SSL
        ssl_certificate         /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key     /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem;
        ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/chain.pem;

        # reverse proxy
        location / {
                proxy_pass         http://localhost:8087/;
                proxy_set_header   Host $http_host;
                proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
                proxy_redirect http://127.0.0.1:8080 https://recipes.example.com;
        }

        location /media/ {
                root   /media/;
                index  index.html index.htm;
        }
}

# HTTP redirect
server {
        listen      80;
        listen      [::]:80;
        server_name recipes.example.com;
        include     custom.d/letsencrypt.conf;

        if ($host ~ ^[^.]+\.example\.com$) {
                return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
        }
}
#+end_src

Save and close the configuration file and then restart the web server.

#+begin_src shell
sudo systemctl restart nginx.service
#+end_src

The app is now available on your custom domain!
